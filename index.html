            <h2>Introduction:</h2>
            <p class= "floatmargin"> There is no greater feeling than having your bags packed and knowing you’re ready to go on your next adventure. There are few things in life that will impact you as much as traveling will. Something happens to us when we board a plane in one country and land in another—it’s almost as if our eyes open again for the first time. The excitement and life experiences that happen when you travel are unlike anything else. It’s hard to capture in words the moment when you see the sunset behind the Colosseum in Rome or when you finally can understand what someone is saying in another language.
